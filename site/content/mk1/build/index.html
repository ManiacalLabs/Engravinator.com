            <p>We are currently finalizing the build documentation and making it look awesome!</p>
            <p>So, in the meantime, head on over to the <a href="{{ helpers.getUrl(site, '/mk1/buy/') }}">buy page</a>
                and start getting your parts ready. Also, don't forget to fire up your 3d printer and <a
                    href="{{ helpers.getUrl(site, '/mk1/print/') }}">print the required parts</a>.</p>
            <p>If you are interested in being a beta tester for the documentation and don't want to deal with sourcing
                everything yourself, we have pending plans to offer a read-to-assemble kit with everything you need.
                Drop us a line at <a href="mailto:engravinator@maniacallabs.com">engravinator@maniacallabs.com</a> and
                let us know you're interested.</p>
