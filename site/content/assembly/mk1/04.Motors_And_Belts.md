# Motors and Belts

## Tools Required

- 2.5mm Hex Key for M3 Bolts
- ?mm Hex Key for set screws
- Snippers for cutting belt

## Step 1

- `Y_Motor_Mount` (x1)
- `Y_Pulley_Mount` (x1)
- M5x10mm Bolt, CB5-10 (x5)
- Post Assembly Spring Nut, HNTP5-5 (x5)
- GT2-16 3mm Bore Idler Pulley (x1)
- GT2-16 5mm Bore Drive Pulley (x1)
- NEMA 17 Stepper Motor
- ?mm bolt (x4)
- ?mm bolt (x1)
- M3 nut (x1)

## Step 2

- One the back, drive-side of the machine mount `Y_Motor_Mount` so that it is sitting directly on top of the rod holder, as shown, using 3 pairs of M5x10mm bolts and spring nuts. Note that the 2 spring nuts on the inside channel of the extrusion need to be inserted in the orientation shown. (pic from fusion with transparency)
- Using the 4 ?mm bolts, mount the NEMA 17 stepper motor to the mount ensuring the the wires coming out of the motor are facing down. Wrap these up to keep them out of the way for now.
- Slide the GT2-16 drive pulley over the motor shaft, as shown, so that one of the set screws is aligned with the flat edge on the shaft. Only lightly tighten that one set screw for now.
- One the front, drive-side of the machine mount `Y_Pulley_Mount` so that it is sitting directly on top of the rod holder, as shown, using 2 pairs of M5x10mm bolts and spring nuts. Note that the 2 spring nuts need to be inserted in the orientation shown. (pic from fusion with transparency)
- Place the GT2-16 idler pulley into the mount and pass the ?mm bolt through it, then secure with a bolt inserted into the hexagonal recess. Tighten until finger tight.


## Step 3

- `Y_Tensioner` (x1)
- M3x30mm Bolt (x1)
- M3 nut (x1)


## Step 4

- Take the belt inserted into `Y_Drive_Main` and run it through the idler pulley as shown the back to the motor and around the drive pulley, as shown.
- Slide the X-Axis assembly to the back (towards the motor) and pull the belt tight. Holding it over the Y-Axis drive block there is a marking on the top showing where the belt needs to be cut. Cut the belt with the snippers where it meets that mark.
- Now insert the end of the belt into `Y_Tensioner` (*note that this tensioner marked with one dot whereas the one for the X-Axis is marked with 2 dots and is a mirror image*).
- Insert the M3 nut into the slot in the tensioner and then insert it into the Y-Axis block as shown, making sure the nut doesn't fall out.
- Now insert the M3x30mm bolt into the other side and turn until it grabs onto the nut and starts pulling the tensioner block in. **DO NOT** fully tension it at this point. We will come back to that.
