# Y-Axis Assembly

## Step 1 - Tools Required

- 2.5mm Hex Key for M3 Bolts
- Snippers for cutting belt
- `HeightTool` printed part

## Step 2

- `4x_RodHolder` (x4)
- M5x10mm Bolt, CB5-10 (x8)
- Post Assembly Spring Nut, HNTP5-5 (x8)
- Previously assemblyed frame

## Step 3

- On each of the upright 200mm extrusions (these are the "Z-axis") insert two of the spring nuts into the channel on the inner edge, as shown. You must make sure that each is in **************** orientation as shown in the image.
- Insert 2 of the M5x10 bolts into each of `4x_RodHolder` parts and mate those up on each of the 4 extrusion uprights with the inserted spring nuts. Make sure that the hexagonal recess is facing down on each. Tighten only slightly so they stay on.
- Place the frame on a flat surface again and then take the `HeightTool` and place as shown under each `4x_RodHolder`. This will set the same height for all holders (it is 60mm from the bottom of the frame to the bottom of the holder).
- With `HeightTool` in place tighten both bolts on each of the rod holders to keep them in place.

## Step 4

- 250mm x 8mm Linear Rod, PSFJ8-250 (x2)
- M3 nut (x4)
- ?mm bolt (x4)
