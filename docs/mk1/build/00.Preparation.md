## Important Advice

Follow *all* the rules below and you will have a great experience!

-   **Always read _all_ the instructions for each step first**, as it will give you better context and understanding of what you need to do.
-   Read the instructions and don't just follow the pictures! The written instructions are as short as possible.
-   **Never cut or trim anything unless told to!!**
-   **Don't force it.** The printed parts will hold up to a lot of abuse but are not indestructible. If something isn't fitting right, recheck the instructions.
-   When in doubt, hit up the [Engravinator Forum](https://forum.maniacallabs.com/c/engravinator). We know you want to get it done *now* but better to ask then break something.
-   Use a comfortable chair and an appropriate work surface. Seriously, you will be working on this for a while and it's best to be comfortable.
-   **Have fun!!** If you didn't like building things you probably wouldn't have taken on this task, but it's worth stating anyways. Take your time and enjoy the process.
