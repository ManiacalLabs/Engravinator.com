# Controller

**Note 1:** The Engravinator is a flexible platform that is capable of using a wide variety of controller boards. It you bought a kit from Maniacal Labs, it likely came with the [Platypus](https://ManiacalLabs.com/Platypus) controller so that's what we will show here. It was designed specifically with the Engravinator in mind and simplifies the process as much as possible. Installing another controller will likely be very similar. Please check out the [Controllers Info](https://engravinator.com/controllers) for more on using another controller.

**Note 2:** This section assumes that you already have a fully assembled controller board with stepper drivers installed and configured correctly. If you are using the [Platypus](https://ManiacalLabs.com/Platypus) please refer to its [documentation](https://github.com/ManiacalLabs/Platypus/blob/master/docs/Usage.md) for correct setup. If using another controller please refer to its documentation.

**Note 3:** From here on you may notice a green, instead of black, controller board in a few pictures. The main assembly guide pictures were taken before the final Platypus board was complete. Anything important shows the correct, newer, board.

## Tools Required

<a href="/mk1/img/build/111.jpg" data-imagelightbox="a"><img src="/mk1/img/build/thumb/111.jpg"></a>

-   2.5mm Hex Key for M3 bolts
-   4mm Hex Key for M5 bolts
-   Wire strippers
-   Wire snips

## Controller Base Plate

### Components

<a href="/mk1/img/build/174.jpg" data-imagelightbox="b"><img src="/mk1/img/build/thumb/174.jpg"></a>

-   <span class="dot red"></span> [BasePlate_Platypus](https://github.com/ManiacalLabs/Engravinator/blob/master/Mk1/Fabrication/3D_Printed/Controller_Box/BasePlate_Platypus.stl) (x1)
-   <span class="dot green"></span> M5x10mm bolt, CB5-10 (x2)
-   <span class="dot blue"></span> Post Assembly Spring Nut, HNTP5-5 (x2)
-   <span class="dot purple"></span> M3x5mm bolt (x4)
-   Platypus Controller Board

### Mount Base Plate

<a href="/mk1/img/build/114.jpg" data-imagelightbox="c"><img src="/mk1/img/build/thumb/114.jpg"></a>
<a href="/mk1/img/build/115.jpg" data-imagelightbox="c"><img src="/mk1/img/build/thumb/115.jpg"></a>

-   Insert the 2 spring nuts as shown
-   Place M5 bolts through the holes in the base plate and use them to better align the spring nuts. The base plate should be flush with the side and bottom.
-   Tighten the bolts.

### Mount Controller

<a href="/mk1/img/build/116.jpg" data-imagelightbox="d"><img src="/mk1/img/build/thumb/116.jpg"></a>

-   Using the 4 M3x5mm bolts, mount the controller to the base plate as shown. As the bolts are threaded directly into the plastic do not overtighten them. As tight as you can get them with 2 fingers is fine.
-   Be sure that the USB and Power ports are facing out to the left (while looking at the back).

## Controller Wiring

### Motors

<a href="/mk1/img/build/168.jpg" data-imagelightbox="e"><img src="/mk1/img/build/thumb/168.jpg"></a>

-   Run the X motor cable through the lower right hole on the base plate.
-   If using a motor without a terminating connector, pull the wires towards the X motor terminal on the controller to determine the total length you need. You may trim off any excess, making sure to leave enough to comfortably reach the terminal. If you do, be sure to strip ~3mm of insulation from the end of each wire.
-   Using the screw terminals or male header (if your motor has a female header on the cable) connect the wires as follows (assuming you are using the motor in the BOM):
    -   A+ -> Blue
    -   A- -> Red
    -   B+ -> Green
    -   B- -> Black
-   Now run the Y motor cable through the same base plate hole and repeat the steps above, except use the follow wire order:
    -   A+ -> Black
    -   A- -> Green
    -   B+ -> Red
    -   B- -> Blue

### Limit Switches

<a href="/mk1/img/build/169.jpg" data-imagelightbox="f"><img src="/mk1/img/build/thumb/169.jpg"></a>
<a href="/mk1/img/build/170.jpg" data-imagelightbox="f"><img src="/mk1/img/build/thumb/170.jpg"></a>

-   Run the X limit switch cable through the top-right hole in the base plate.
-   Strip ~3mm of insulation from the ends of the wires (if not already) and connect it to the Limit terminal where it's marked X. Polarity doesn't matter.
-   Run the Y limit switch cable through the same hole and repeat the same connection process, but where it's marked Y.

### Laser / Servo Connection

<a href="/mk1/img/build/171.jpg" data-imagelightbox="g"><img src="/mk1/img/build/thumb/171.jpg"></a>

-   Run your cable through the top-middle base plate hole.
-   If your laser cable came with a cable that terminates in dual 2-pin connectors:
    -   Red is 12V
    -   Black is Ground
    -   Yellow is PWM
-   If your laser cable terminates in a single 3-pin connector:
    -   Red is 12V
    -   Black is Ground
    -   Yellow is PWM
-   If you are using a servo, use the servo connector shown. **NOTE!!** The servo uses 5V instead of 12V. If you connect to the headers marked for the laser you will blow up your servo!
    -   Black is Ground
    -   Red is 5V
    -   Orange is PWM/Signal
-   The Platypus has discrete male headers for each of the above listed options. But it is honestly easier to use the `Servo|Laser` screw terminal and follow the color coding listed above to connect each wire to the right spot. We like screw terminals so this is what we've shown above. If you have 2 black/ground wires, just insert them into the same terminal slot.


Hooray, you're nearly there! Don't worry about putting the controller cover on at this point. Let's do some pre-flight checks in the next section.
Also, if you have the enclosure, we will install that *after* the pre-flight checks.
